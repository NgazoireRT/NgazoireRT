- ðŸ‘‹ Helloooo, thank you for visiting my page.

- My Name is Robert Takenzire.  I have worked in financials services mainly within the banking sector for the past 10years in what is deemed client facing customer centric or sales roles, which has helped me build a unique set of skills.  I have always been fascinated by tech industry and decided in 2023 to take the leap and enrolled onto the London Shool Econmics and Politcal Science [LSE] - Data Analytics Career Accelerator course.  I thoroughly enjoyed this course as intense as it was and this only strengthened my belief to cultivate a career switch into tech role.
  
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ...Data Analytics and Machine learning and with the birth of AI revolution, this has only served to enhance my curiosity and have now enrolled into Data Science & Machine learning online course at CodeCademy, in the search of knowledge as the new frontier and where the journey may lead.
