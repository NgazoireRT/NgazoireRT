- ðŸ‘‹ Helloooo, thank you for visiting my page.

- My Name is Bob!  I have worked in financial services mainly within the banking sector for the past 10years in what is deemed client facing customer centric or sales roles, which has helped me build a unique set of skills.  I have always been fascinated by tech industry and decided in 2023 to take the leap and enrolled onto the London Shool Econmics and Politcal Science [LSE] - Data Analytics Career Accelerator course.  I thoroughly enjoyed this course as intense as it was and this only strengthened my belief to cultivate a career switch into tech role.  Currently working in Risk as Software Engineer, at the very begining of this exciting journey
  
ðŸ‘€ Im currently learning Python and hope to complete some projects to showcase on here and perhaps then pick up another language.
